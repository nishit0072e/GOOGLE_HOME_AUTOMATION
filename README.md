A Google Assistant controlled home automation system built using NodeMCU ESP8266 is a smart home solution that allows you to control various household devices with your voice through Google Assistant.

NodeMCU ESP8266 is a small Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that is widely used in DIY projects and IoT applications due to its affordability and ease of use. It can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and can easily connect to the internet using Wi-Fi.

To build a Google Assistant controlled home automation system, you will need to connect the NodeMCU ESP8266 to various household devices, such as lights, fans, and switches. You can do this by wiring the NodeMCU ESP8266 to a relay module that can control the power supply to these devices.

Next, you will need to create a Google Assistant applet using services such as IFTTT (If This Then That) or Google Actions. This applet will allow you to trigger voice commands that can be sent to the NodeMCU ESP8266 through the internet.

Once the applet is set up, you can use your voice to turn on or off devices connected to the NodeMCU ESP8266. For example, you can say "Hey Google, turn off the lights in the living room" and Google Assistant will send a command to the NodeMCU ESP8266 to turn off the relay connected to the lights.

Overall, building a Google Assistant controlled home automation system using NodeMCU ESP8266 can be an exciting and rewarding project for DIY enthusiasts who are interested in home automation and IoT. It can save you time and make your life more convenient by allowing you to control various devices in your home with your voice.https://github.com/nishit0072e/GOOGLE_HOME_AUTOMATION.git
