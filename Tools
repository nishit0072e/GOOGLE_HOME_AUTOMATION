To do this home automation by your own make sure you have created an id in adafruit.io as well as in IFTTT.
At first in adafruit.io you have to create a feed for relays and then you have to generate a adafruit key from there.
Then you have to link your google assistant to ifttt and adafruit.io also.
Then place then adafuit key in the code and upload that on your nodemcu.
